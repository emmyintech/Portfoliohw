# Emmy’s Portfolio

This project is my first homework assignment for the Code Bootcamp. I was given a template to match and created a website with three pages from scratch as well as add style with a fourth external .css page. This project is helpful because an online portfolio can showcase your work and I look forward to adding to this site as I go through this bootcamp. I was able to see what I am capable of and how I was able to overcome challenges. 


### Installing

You need the internet and a browser to be able to view the pages and a code application such as Visual Studio Code to view the code or you can inspect it in the dev tools available in the browser.
