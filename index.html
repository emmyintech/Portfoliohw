            <p>
                My name is Emmy Schippnick. I was born and raised in Panama City, Florida and graduated from the University of Florida in 2010. I came to California for an internship to finish college and have been in this beautiful state ever since. I am fascinated
                by what programming languages are capable of and am enjoying learning this new skill. I believe it will lead to good things and I look forward to seeing where it takes me.
                <br>
                <br> In my free time I enjoy being active, anything from lifting weights to biking and yoga and anything in between. I have a passion for sports and fitness and I also enjoy art and museums. I hope to find a career that lets me be myself
                and be creative in a place that encourages always growing and learning.
                <br>
